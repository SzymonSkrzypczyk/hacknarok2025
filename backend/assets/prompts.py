PROMPT_GET_TAGS = """
You are a tagging assistant that analyzes social media posts and classifies them using a predefined list of tags.

## INPUT:

You will receive:
- A list of social media posts (variable length, indexed from 1)
- A list of existing tags

## TASK:

1. For **each post**, determine which of the existing tags apply.
2. Only include new tags if they are:
   - Clearly and specifically relevant to the content
   - Not already captured by the existing tags
   - Unavoidable for proper classification

IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A TAG, FIRST CHECK IF THIS TAG DOESN'T EXIST IN EXISTING TAGS!!! DO NOT USE ABBREVIATIONS!
RETURN THE MINIMUM POSSIBLE NUMBER OF TAGS PER POST (MINIMUM 1, MAXIMUM 2) LET THEM BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE!


Return a JSON object where each key is the index of the post, and the value is an object:
RETURN ONLY THE JSON IN PLAIN TEXT AND NOTHING ELSE so it's easily converted with json.loads()

example:
```json
{{
  "1": {{
    "matched_tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
  }},
  "2": {{
    "matched_tags": ["tag1", "tag4", "tag5"]
  }}
  ...
}}
```
POSTS:

{posts}

ALREADY_EXISTING_TAGS (if doesn't exist, generate tags that you find fitting to the posts!)

{tags}

"""

PROMPT_SUMMARIZE_BY_TAG = """
You are an AI assistant that generates a summary for a single social media tag and its associated posts.

You will receive a JSON object where:
- The key is a single tag (e.g., "tech" or "smartphones").
- The value is a list of social media post contents associated with that tag.

Your task: For the given tag, write:
1. A **short_summary**: a 1-sentence summary capturing the key idea from the full list of posts.
2. A **brief_summary**: a more detailed summary (2–4 sentences) that gives a broader understanding of the common topic discussed in the posts.

Instructions:
- You must take into account **every single post** in the list when generating the summaries.
- Do not ignore or generalize — base your summaries on actual content and recurring themes.
- Do not invent any facts or speculate beyond what's explicitly stated in the posts.
- Avoid repetition and overly generic phrases.
- Your output must strictly follow the structure provided below.
- If there are no posts specified, return an empty JSON object {{}}.

ALWAYS RETURN PLAIN TEXT THAT WILL BE EASILY PARSED BY json.loads() FUNCTION!
ALWAYS RETURN THE PROPER JSON, SO ALWAYS ENSURE IT'S WELL FORMATED!

Return the result in this exact JSON format:
{{
  "short_summary": "...",
  "brief_summary": "..."
}}

THE CONTENT:
